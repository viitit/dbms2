9.  Consider following schema
Student(Roll_no, Name, City)
Subject(sub_code, sub_name)
Marks(Roll_no, sub_code, marks)
Write following queries in SQL
1.	Find average marks of each student, along with the name of student.
2.	Find how many students have failed in the subject “DBMS”.
3.	Display Highest & lowest marks for every subject.
4.	Find students with city staring from  ‘P’ 
5.	Find students with city name ends with ‘Pur’
6.	Display Subject Name, Highest & lowest marks scored.
